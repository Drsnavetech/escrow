## A smart contract for realEstate 

# How does it work?

- The contract is deployed, and 3 nfts (real estate properties) are minted 
- A buyer makes an offer on a property
- Earnest Payment is made
- nft and payment enters escrow (the smart contract address)
- the buyer and seller have options to approve the exchange
- when both parties approves and the balance money is paid
- the nft is transfered to the buyer's address
- the contract balance is transfered to the seller/owner's address
